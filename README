Introduction
------------

The motivation behind this project was the necessity of synchronize between two
MySQL databases but when pass the information to the other was necessary made
some changes in the value before add in the destination. If the synchronization
was limited only to sync the fields we can used the replication, but
the case was, request additional information that will change the result of the 
field and this case we needed a flexive place that we able to add this queries
to make the operation.
